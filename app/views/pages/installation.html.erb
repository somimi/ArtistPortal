<b>Interactive Installations</b>

<p>Interactive installation art is extremely popular at the Seattle Erotic Art Festival, and artists enjoy significant notoriety as a result of media and audience reviews. We are seeking work that encourages the audience to become part of the art, that creates a memorable Festival experience, and that is physically, emotionally and creatively stimulating.</p>

<p>The Festival is proud to continue to offer our grant for interactive visual artists. Selected artists will be granted up to $750 to create works of art that feature a participatory element.</p>
