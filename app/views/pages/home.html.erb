<h3><center>About the Seattle Erotic Art Festival</h3></center>

<p>The Seattle Erotic Art Festival supports a vibrant creative community, promotes freedom of expression, and fosters sex positive culture through public celebration of the arts.</p>

<p>The Festival is a jury-selected, erotic fine art exhibition and curated arts festival. Selected art will be showcased over the course of the event to thousands of patrons across two weekends in June.</p>

<p>Our curators and juries select work that is based on quality of execution, originality of subject, and depth of emotion. We strive to be a place that showcases the diversity of human sexual expression and explores the vast creativity that artists use to approach their subjects, a place where art that is rarely seen in mainstream galleries and museums can be celebrated, discussed and supported.</p>
<p>For the second year, the Festival will be held at Fremont Studios. The venue is well-equipped to professionally showcase all art forms, featuring ample space and high-quality lighting for an impressive visual art gallery and large Festival Store, a modern 50-seat movie theater for film, a built-in stage for performance art, and more.</p>

<p>The 10th annual Festival will be June 16-24, 2012.</p>
