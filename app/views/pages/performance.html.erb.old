<b>About David Crellin (aka Armitage Shanks)</b>
<p>Crellin has a colorful history of experience, having worked as a circus performer, singer, director, actor, writer, musician, teacher and stuntman in a career spanning 30 years. He was the co-founder and ringmaster of Circus Contraption, a Seattle-based, one-ring, traveling circus. Directing and co-writing credits include Squirm Burpee - A Vaudevillian Melodrama, which premiered at the New Victory Theater in New York City’s Times Square; Up, with a Twist for the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts (SANCA); and The Breaking, starring the Can Can Castaways.</p>

<b>Vision for 2012 Performance</b>
<p>Crellin shares his vision: “to create an exploration of sex and sexuality that illuminates the erotic in a resonant and allegorical fashion, to accentuate the sacred and the profane, beauty and ugliness, pathos and humor -- all parts of our shared erotic experience.”</p>
<p>Crellin will choose acts from a wide range of performance styles including but not limited to: modern dance (in all its forms), parkour, extreme sports, ballet, aerial arts, circus arts, vaudeville, cabaret, butoh, drag, mask and puppet work, swing or ballroom dance, burlesque, multi-media and mixed media. (Note that fire performance is not possible in this venue.) Selections made will inform the narrative structure created by Crellin, to enhance and support the Festival’s 2012 theme, which is yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Additionally, there will be ambient and satellite environments featuring original or adaptive thematic performance. Ambient performances are, by their nature, more geared toward solo or small group interaction and brevity.</p>

<p>"Erotic" is open to a variety of interpretations from the familiar to the boldly unexpected. Performances should represent the powerful diversity of our personal eroticism.</p>
